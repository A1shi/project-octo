# Kensaki
The one place you need to go to in order to learn all the knowledge the Splatoon 2 Researchers have.


## Database
Will contain all of the knowledge.

Features:
- What guns are better than others
- What abilities do
- Stats of every individual gun
- What every ability does
- What every ability does in specific to items (ex. Main Power Up's effects for Kensa Splattershot)
- [Builds](#builds)
- [Map Knowledge](#map-knowledge)

Is queryable (1 api call for all the data requested (ex: GRAPHQL) )

Is hosted.

Is able to be changed, preferablly through the website.

In order to be changed, has to either:

- Have a key, bypassing requirement 2.
- Be approved by someone with a key.

## Website
Will be the place showing all the knowledge.

Features:
- [Database](#database) Queryer
- [Build Analyzer](#build-analyzer) (take [loadout.ink](https://selicia.github.io) as an example (we will just make a better version) )
- [Builds](#builds) (take [this](https://sendou.ink/builds) as an example)
- [Maps](#maps)
- [Tournaments](#tournaments)
- Dark and Light theme.

It will look like an app on a phone, giving the vibe that their Splatoon OC/Character is looking at this website on their phone (except it's an app to them). Website (online) will have a loading animation like it was an app, along with an update bar if we update the website.  The PWA will just use the phone for opening animation, while using the website for updating animation.

## Build Analyzer
Will help Octolings and Inklings alike plan their gear.
